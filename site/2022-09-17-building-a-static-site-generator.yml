title: Building a Static Site Generator

I'm taking a mini-sabbatical.  No, I'm not in academia.  I'm a 20 year programmer who's acheived a lot of his goals and is now planning what comes next.

### The PLAN
```
1. Writing is hard enough.  This tool should stay out of the way when we're writing.  
2. There will be no database backend.

4. Don't waste time mucking with styling while writing.  See 1.
5. Don't forget some problems are solved.
6. Editing is writing, so, it should be as easy as writing.
