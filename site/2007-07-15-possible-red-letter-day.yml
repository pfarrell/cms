I guess all Red Letter Days are always just possible ones since only the passage of time solidifies that distinction.Agile Web Development with Rails

While I have been reading about and running through some basic Ruby tutorials for the past couple of months, I had yet to set up a Ruby on Rails app. OMFG. I am starting a project, with my old friend Jeff, to let me explore a full lifecycle on an app.  I am completely wowed by the ease, terseness, and functionality provided by Rails right out of the box. I am so amazed, I am launching a new category, Ruby.

Amazon already profited from my experiences with the purchase of a ROR book, Agile Web Development with Rails.
