I'm sitting here, wrapping up a short, self-funded sabbatical I've decided to take after being laid off in September.  I'm at the completion of a decade long journey that started with a move to California, working at several startups, through founding my own startup, getting it acquired, delivering at the acquiring company, then getting caught by layoffs due to funding challenges.  I decided to use the severance package and some savings to take a break and reevaluate where I'm going.

The reason I was laid off is due to a shake-up happening in the tech world.  In the Spring of 2022, we had some variables change that quickly reverberated into the industry.  Besides Ukraine's struggles, the funding equation flipped and investment money went from valuing uncontrolled growth to wanting a return on investment.  Tech darling companies are having layoffs left and right. Money is no longer cheap and businesses failed to see it coming.

There's been a lot of schadenfreude about this.  About how the industry was acting irrationally, how many terrible ideas were getting funded, how we now *deserve* the downturn.

I say we were doing exactly what we should have been doing given the circumstances.  The tide was in for everyone and we used the good times to stretch.  Remember [yo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_(app))?  

The excellent, ancient BBC series *Connections*, by James Burke, taught me that you can't predict things, when the time for an idea will be right, or what we're doing now that's going to affect the future.  While the funding was plentiful, it was a good time to harness that excitement and opportunity.

The only thing that some did wrong was expecting the good times to last forever.  The good times will be back, someday, but all parties come to an end.
