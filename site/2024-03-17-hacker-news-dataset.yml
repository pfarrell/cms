summary: Notes on capturing Hacker News
title: Assembling the Hacker News dataset
---
Feb. 7, 2023 was the 15th anniversary of the creation of my [username](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pfarrell) on Hacker News.  Except for a three year hiatus, it's been a site I visit daily to keep up with new projects, learn about other areas of tech, and learn more about portions of our world.  Hacker News was launched in 2007 and contains a trove of knowledge, hot takes, and history. 

These notes are my personal observations and since I'm not affiliated with YCombinator, Microsoft, or Google, I'm not warranting this the most efficient way, but it works for me and my purposes.

We _could_ scrape the actual website, but with close to 39.8 records (as of March 2024), at 10 records per second, we're looking at 45 days to get the full data set.

Some research I did shows there is a backup on Micrsoft's BigQuery and there is a Firebase database that is updated in near real time.  We can use the BigQuery data to download a historical chunk and then get more recent data from Firebase. 

### Schema

|column|data type| notes|
|---|---|---|
|id|int|numeric id for the submission|
|type|string|item type, one of story, comment, job, poll, pollopt|
|score|int|story points, comment points are not publicly avaialble|
|by|string|username of submitter|
|title|string|title of submission, null if type is not story|
|url|string|link for stories, null if type is not story|
|text|string|comment text, generally null if type is story|
|time|int|unix epoch time of publishing|
|parent|int|parent item.  null if type is story|
|descendants|int|number of item descedants|

### Data Locations

#### The Archive
You can find an historical archive of hacker news hosted on [Google's BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=hacker_news).  Unfortunately, the data stopped being updated `2022-11-16 09:12:32 UTC`.  We'll call that our data epoch.  Everything in that set is fixed and assumed to be good.

#### Hacker News API (Firebase)
Firebase provides some client libraries that can capture changes as near real time events.  The design of this project is to build a dataset, not mirror the data in real time, so we'll go for a more quick and dirty daily download of new data (i.e. items we haven't seen before) and we can upsert stories and comments that are older than a few days so we get the "final" story scores and comment edits.  _Final_ because technically points can change over time, but rarely change after a few days from post. 

#### Building our dataset

* Download the BigQuery data
* Download item data from Firebase from data epoch to present
* Merge data into a database
* [Scripts](https://github.com/pfarrell/hn-chrono/tree/main/bin) to upsert database with latest data 

#### Publishing the dataset

Still a work in progress.  For now (while github allows it), a csv exports of item level data is available at [hn-data](https://patf.com/hn-data)
