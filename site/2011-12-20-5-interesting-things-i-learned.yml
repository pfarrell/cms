*A Visit from St. Nicholas*, aka *The Night Before Christmas*, is a poem from 1837 by Clement Clark Moore that we all know by heart.  File this under too much time on my hands.  A few things I noticed re-reading it, this year.

###5. Santa smokes!
      The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,  
      And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.  
       
###4. In the 1820s, houses could have shutters on the inside
      Away to the window I flew like a flash,
      Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

###3. Santa uses magic to get up the chimney like Samantha on *Bewitched*
      And laying his finger aside of his nose,
      And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!
  
  
###2. The reindeer and the sleigh are tiny
      When what to my wondering eyes should appear,
      But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.
                                  
*..because*
  
###1. Santa, himself, is an ELF!
      He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
  
  
###Bonus
  
Let's say you owned eight flying reindeer, you'd be hard pressed to pick a better name than, **Comet**.  Until, of course, you though of **Donner** and **Blitzen**.  Why? Because, those names are German for *thunder* and *lightning*.
  
Santa is so metal.
  
Dancer and Prancer must be pissed.
