I've had a television show in my mind for a long time. My father is an excellent storyteller with a superhuman ability to remember people and events. The show would be germinated from stories I heard of his career in Indianapolis in the 1970's and 80's.  Mirroring the establishment of a law firm is the growth of a city. Being a lawyer show, it could return to an episodic nature. 

But the main theme wouldn't center around my father, it would be about his boss, who build a hugely successful practice, created a respected firm, then drove it into the ground and is now back to being a lawyer. The main thing is the ambition and drive to create the fire is the same thing that eventually extinguishes it.



Back to my show idea though... When I mentiooned it to my sister, she said "It sounds good, but it sounds a lot like Mad Men." <pencil snap.gif>
