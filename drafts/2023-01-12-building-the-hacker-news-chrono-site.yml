title: Building the Hacker News Chrono Site
---
Feb. 7, 2023 will be the 15th anniversary of the creation of my [username](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pfarrell) on Hacker News.  Except for a three year hiatus, it's been a site I visit daily to keep up with new projects, learn about other areas of tech, and learn more about portions of our world.  Hacker News about 17 and half years old and contains a wealth of knowledge and history when dataset. 

This project is about building some tools to look at that dataset in new ways.

So where do we start?  Well, we need the dataset, right?

## Building our dataset

Since this is a personal project, I'm going to try to this cheaply.  ![good and cheap but not fast](img/good_and_cheap.png)
